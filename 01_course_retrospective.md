## 1. What went well

- I felt confident working with **React components**, particularly understanding how components can be reused by importing and exporting them across different files.
- My understanding of **Git** improved significantly. While I had prior experience using Git, the discussions throughout the semester helped me better understand commands such as `git reset`, `git rebase`, and `git revert`, especially when fixing mistakes.
- I learned the importance of **micro-committing and macro-committing**, as well as following proper **commit message conventions**, which helped improve collaboration and code organization.

## 2. What went wrong / Challenges

- More advanced React topics, such as useEffect and Redux, were challenging, particularly when applying them independently in real projects and designing the correct logic for specific use cases.

- I encountered issues with the difference between **local and live environments**, where some features worked locally but caused problems after deployment.
- During the project, our team struggled with adjusting to assigned roles and managing tasks, which affected coordination and efficiency.

## 3. Key Learnings
- I strengthened my understanding of **JavaScript basics**, which helped me feel more confident when building dynamic features in our projects.  
- Working with **React** was exciting—I enjoyed creating components and experimenting with hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` to make the app interactive.  
- Using **Git and version control** became much more practical for me; I now feel comfortable fixing mistakes and collaborating with my team without fear of breaking anything.  
- Learning about the **Five Dysfunctions of a Team** made me more aware of how trust, communication, and accountability affect our project’s success, and I tried to apply this understanding in our group work.  
- - I also learned the importance of being punctual, disciplined, attentive, and professional, which helped me develop stronger personal work habits and stay focused on tasks.

## 4. Areas for Improvement

- I want to further improve my understanding of **application development** and strengthen my grasp of **key concepts in React**, so I can apply them more confidently in real projects.
- To contribute better in team projects, I plan to **utilize my strengths more effectively**, continue improving my weaknesses, and focus more on what the team needs.
- I also learned the importance of **proper planning and having backup plans** to mitigate risks that could affect project progress.

## 5. Expectations for Mobile Development (AppDev2)

- I expect to learn the **foundations of React Native and TypeScript**, which will help me better understand mobile application development.
- I expect the discussions to remain educational, practical and hands-on, as this approach helps me understand and retain concepts more effectively rather than just memorizing information.
